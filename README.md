### Directory Structure and File Placement

1. **Root Directory**: Place the README file here for it to be displayed automatically on the repository's main page.
2. **.github Directory**: You can also place the README in a hidden `.github` directory for organization purposes. GitHub will still recognize it.
3. **docs Directory**: If you have multiple README files, placing one in the `docs` directory ensures it is recognized if not found in the root or `.github` directories.

### Profile README

If you want to create a profile README that appears on your GitHub profile page, create a public repository with the same name as your GitHub username. Add a README file to this repository to personalize your profile. For more information, see [Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

### Additional Notes

- **Auto-generated Table of Contents:** For the rendered view of any Markdown file in a repository, including README files, GitHub will automatically generate a table of contents based on section headings. You can view the table of contents for a README file by clicking the menu icon at the top left of the rendered page.
  
- **Section Links:** You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link icon.

- **Relative Links and Image Paths:** Use relative links to refer to other files within your repository. This ensures that links and paths remain functional even when the repository is cloned.
